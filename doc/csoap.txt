cSOAP is a C-based implementation of the Simple Object Access Protocol
(SOAP) version 1.1.

SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a
decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol
that consists of three parts:
- an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a
  message and how to process it,
- a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of
  application-defined datatypes,
- and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and
  responses.
SOAP can potentially be used in combination with a variety of other
protocols; however, the only bindings defined in library are HTTP
and UDP.
